**1. The Number of Retiring Employees by Title** 
 
  * Based on the number of employees with uniqe titles it shows that there are about 72,458 employees that will be retiring soon.

**2. The Employees Eligible for the Mentorship Program**

  * After filtering the data to retrieve employees whose birth dates are between January 1, 1965 and December 31, 1965 we have found that out of the 72,458 employees retiring 1,940 employees qualify to be a part of the Mentorship program.

## Summary: 
Provide high-level responses to the following questions, then provide two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight into the upcoming "silver tsunami."

There will be about **70,000 roles** that will need to be filled once the "silver tsunami" begins, there are not enough mentors available to mentor the next generation. With only about **1,900** eligibile mentors that means each mentor would need to 35 mentees in order to bring the next generation of employees up to speed. 

Some ways to possibly combat the drastic effects of the "silver tsunami" will be to mitigate employee retention for the remaining employees. This means that Pewlett Hackard will can allocate the some of the salary for raises or promotions of the current employees. Overall this will increase employee well-being and prevent any premature turnover.
